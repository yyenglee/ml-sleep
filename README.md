# ml-sleep
Script used to build machine learning model to predict sleep genes. Features are built using two lines of information. <br />
 -  Similarity of each genes to sleep genes are calculate using "calc_JaccardIndex.py". <br />
 -  Genome-wide dataset are evaluated and selected with evidence factors using "calc_EvidenceFactors.R". <br />
